# PAI Task 2 – Algorithms and Data Structures

This task applies core algorithms and data structures taught in the Programming for AI module to a supermarket transactions dataset.

The dataset contains 38,765 rows with the following attributes: `Member_number`, `Date`, and `itemDescription`.

The implementation includes:
- Linear search to retrieve all purchases for a given member (O(n))
- Merge sort to order data by member number and item frequency (O(n log n))
- Binary search to efficiently locate member purchase ranges in sorted data (O(log n))
- Dictionary-based frequency counting for items (O(n))

All algorithms are implemented explicitly without relying on built-in sorting or searching functions.  
Time complexity is discussed to compare algorithm efficiency and justify design choices.
